Playwright E2E Automation Framework
This project is a robust, scalable, and data-driven end-to-end automation framework built with Playwright, designed to ensure seamless quality assurance for modern web applications.

✨ Key Features
Cross-Browser Testing: Effortlessly run tests on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit for maximum coverage.

Data-Driven Testing: Supports Excel and CSV data sources for flexible, parameterized test execution.

Modular Page Object Model: Clean, maintainable code structure with reusable page objects and utilities.

Comprehensive Reporting: Integrated HTML reports and logs for clear visibility into test results and failures.

CI/CD Ready: Pre-configured GitHub Actions workflows for automated test execution on every push or schedule.

API & UI Automation: Unified framework for both UI and REST API validations.

Secure Credential Handling: Environment-based configuration and encrypted secrets for safe test data management.

Reusable Utilities: Rich set of utilities for UI actions, data providers, and reporting.

🚀 Typical Use Cases
Automated regression and smoke testing for web applications
Continuous integration pipelines for rapid feedback
API and UI workflow validation
Data-driven scenario coverage

Suggestions for Improvement:

Test Coverage & Documentation:

Add a badge or summary for code/test coverage.
Expand documentation with setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
Error Handling & Reporting:

Enhance error messages with screenshots on failure for all test steps.
Integrate Slack/Teams notifications for CI failures.
Scalability:

Add support for parallel test execution across browsers.
Consider sharding large test suites for faster CI runs.
Configuration Management:

Use Playwright’s test.use() for per-test configuration overrides.
Externalize more config (timeouts, retries) for flexibility.
Test Data Management:

Add support for dynamic test data generation (faker, randomization).
Implement test data cleanup for API/database state.
Code Quality:

Add linting and formatting (ESLint, Prettier) for code consistency.
Add type-checking and stricter TypeScript rules.
Advanced Features:

Integrate visual regression testing.
Add accessibility (a11y) checks.
Support for mobile emulation and device testing.
Summary:
This framework is robust, maintainable, and CI-ready. With improvements in documentation, scalability, and advanced testing features, it can reach a perfect score.
